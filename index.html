<h2>Big News!!: </h2>

<p> For the first time, two Uptown powerhouses are joining forces to bring Minneapolis something new to sink their teeth into - Eat The World.</p>
<p>On October 11th, Chino Latino and Libertine invite guests to experience a community dining event featuring dishes from the “hot zones,” the diverse band of countries following the equator around the globe. Eight dishes from eight different countries will be thoughtfully paired with beer, wine, and cocktails to highlight their unique culinarily traditions. The community dining experience and adventurous menu make networking at your next event a breeze.</p>

<p>“The  menu is planned out for you, so that you can just relax and enjoy the great company” says Daniel Miles, executive chef at Chino Latino “The chefs have an opportunity to color outside the lines - we can prepare dishes that are a little too eccentric for the daily dinner menu or dishes that are logistically unfeasible to execute on a daily basis. Everyone attending will be eating at one large communal table, and the food will be served family-style, so it's a very social and interactive event.”</p>

<p>Take the planning out of your next event; let these skilled chefs take your guests on an adventure they will never forget.</p>

<p>To make a reservation, contact private dining manager, Catherine Booth, at 612.916.4932 or email cbooth@parasole.com. Space is limited so make your reservations early. </p>

<p>The Party Room offers privacy and versatility for up to 75 people. Sliding doors separate the space from our street-level dining room. A cloud of red lanterns provides flattering lighting (even pasty accountants will look like they just got back from Bali). And during warmer months, the room opens onto a dedicated patio.

The Party Room is AV-ready. From computer hookup and video projector to microphones and music, tell us your tech needs and we’ll help you meet them.</p>

<p>Book the Community Table and you’ll feel like you own the restaurant.

<h2>History: </h2>

<p><strong>The Parasole and Chino Latino story</strong></p>


<p>Chino Latino was Parasole’s millennial baby – born in 2000 and destined to become one of the Twin Cities’ top-grossing restaurants. Five years later, Phil and Parasole’s team of creative and operational partners he dubbed his “kitchen table” created Salut Bar-Américain in Edina, Minnesota, followed by Pittsburgh Blue Steakhouse in Maple Grove, Minnesota.

At the same time Parasole was developing new concepts for itself, the company tapped into its deep well of talent and began offering consulting services to clients nationwide under the auspices of Idein Consulting.

The momentum has only increased </p>
